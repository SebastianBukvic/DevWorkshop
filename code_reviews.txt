Similarities:
1. Focus on Code Quality: Both Yelp and Microsoft emphasize the importance of code quality in their
code reviewer guidelines. They encourage reviewers to pay attention to readability, maintainability, 
performance, and adherence to best practices.
2. Emphasis on Collaboration: Both companies stress the importance of fostering a collaborative and 
respectful environment during code reviews. They encourage reviewers to provide constructive feedback 
and engage in discussions to improve the codebase collectively.

Differences:
1. Tooling and Workflow: Microsoft's guidelines, particularly those for the Visual Studio Mobile team,
may include specific instructions or recommendations for utilizing tools and integrating code review 
into their development workflow within Visual Studio or related tools. Yelp's guidelines may focus more
on general best practices and collaboration strategies without specific tooling recommendations.
2. Scope of Review: The scope of code review may vary between the two companies. For example, Microsoft's
guidelines might include considerations specific to mobile development, such as performance optimizations or
platform-specific APIs, while Yelp's guidelines may be more general and applicable across different types of 
software projects.

Why it's Good: The reviewer provides general remarks praising the effort and functionality of the original code while also
offering constructive feedback for improvement. Specific points of improvement are highlighted, such as

Bad Code Review:
Link: https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/154664/print-a-command-line-argument-100-times
Which Review: It is the review with the 1 likes 
Why it's Bad: The review presents a solution that has significant flaws and does not effectively address 
the original question's requirements. The code does not properly handle long input names, resulting in incorrect output.
There is a lack of explanation or rationale behind the suggested changes, making it difficult for the original poster 
to understand the reasoning behind the modifications. The review does not provide constructive criticism or guidance for 
improvement, making it less helpful for the original poster's learning and development.

Recommendations for Improvement:
The reviewer could provide more detailed explanations for the suggested changes, helping the original poster understand the 
reasoning behind the modifications. It would be beneficial to offer alternative solutions or approaches that address 
the identified issues more effectively. Encouraging the original poster to follow best practices and explaining the 
benefits of certain coding conventions or techniques could enhance the educational value of the review.
